<h1>History Places In Waterfront</h1>
 <h3>Clock Tower</h3>
 <img src="luuuu.jpg" width="40%" height="50%"></img>
 <ul><li>The Clock Tower has begun to lean to one side, about 50 mm. This has since been arrested.</li>
   <li>On the second floor there is a decorative mirror room which allowed the captain an overall view of harbour activities.</li>
   <li>On the ground floor is a tidal gauge mechanism which was used to check the level of the tide for ships entering or leaving the docks.
</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Time Ball Tower</h3>
 <img src="tower.jpg" width="40%" height="80%"></img>
<ul><li>The time ball is an obsolete time signalling device. It consists of a large, painted ball that is dropped at a predetermined time, principally to
     enable navigators to verify their marine chronometers from their ships offshore.</li>

  <li>The first time-ball in Cape Town stood on a wooden tower mid-19th century in Observatory. With the development of
     the docks in the 1860's this ball was no longer visible to ships in the harbour.</li>
  <li> The second time-ball was built on the slopes of Signal Hill. This was replaced by this tower in the V&A Waterfront.</li>
